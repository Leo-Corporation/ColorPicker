## Knowledge
To contribute to this project, you will need to have some prerequisites:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
  - .NET Desktop Developpement
  - Microsoft Blend

## Writing code
Make you follow the following guidelines:

1) Use Tabs: To format your code, use tabs intead of spaces:
~~~ cs
class Car
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The maximum speed of the car.
    /// </summary>
    public int MaxSpeed { get; set; }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// This method does stuff.
    /// </summary>
    public void DoStuff()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("DoStuff"); // Print text
    }
}
~~~
2) Put your code between `{ }`:
~~~ cs
// Do this
int x = 12; // Define a number
int y = 45; // Define another number

if (x < y) // If y is bigger than x
{
    Console.WriteLine("y is bigger than x"); // Print text
}

// Dont do this
if (x < y) // If y is bigger than x
    Console.WriteLine("y is bigger than x"); // Print text
~~~
3) Comment your code:
~~~ cs
int a = 10; // Define a number
int b = 15; // Define another number

if (a > b) // If a is bigger than b
{
    //TODO
}
else
{
    //TODO
}
~~~
4) Use XML Documentation for ``public`` and ``internal`` methods, fields and properties:
~~~ cs
/// <summary>
/// This method does stuff.
/// </summary>
internal void DoStuff()
{
    Thread.Sleep(2000); // Do nothing for 2 seconds
}
~~~
5) Do not forget to put the [license](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/Gavilya/blob/master/LICENSE) header on each `.cs` files:
~~~ cs

6) Use camel case for variables and pascal case for properties and method:
~~~ cs
int myInt = 0; // Declare an int
private int MyInt { get; set; } // Declare an int property

private void DoStuff()
{
    myInt = 2; // Set myInt to 2
}
~~~
That's pretty much all you need right now. Keep in mind this document can be updated at any time, so make sure to keep checking these guidelines.
